        <h2>What is C?</h2>
        <p>The C programming language is a powerful, low-level language that provides fine-grained control over system resources. Created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s, C has become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world, particularly for system and embedded programming.</p>

        <h2>Why Learn C?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Performance:</strong> C is known for its high performance and efficiency. It allows direct manipulation of hardware resources and memory, which is crucial for performance-critical applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Portability:</strong> Programs written in C are portable across different platforms. This means that code written on one system can often be compiled and run on another with minimal changes.</li>
            <li><strong>Foundation for Other Languages:</strong> Understanding C provides a strong foundation for learning other programming languages, such as C++, C#, and Java. Many modern languages borrow concepts and syntax from C.</li>
            <li><strong>System Programming:</strong> C is commonly used for developing operating systems, compilers, and other system-level software. It provides a good understanding of how computers work at a low level.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started with C</h2>
        <p>To begin programming in C, you'll need to set up a development environment. This typically involves installing a C compiler and a text editor. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Install a Compiler:</strong> Choose a C compiler based on your operating system. For Unix-based systems (like Linux or macOS), GCC is a popular choice. On Windows, MinGW or Visual Studio can be used.</li>
            <li><strong>Set Up a Text Editor:</strong> You can write C code in any text editor, but an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) like Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or CLion can provide additional features like syntax highlighting and debugging tools.</li>
            <li><strong>Write Your First Program:</strong> Create a new file with a .c extension, such as <code>hello.c</code>, and write your code.</li>
            <li><strong>Compile the Code:</strong> Use your compiler to translate the C code into an executable program. For example, with GCC, you can compile your code using <code>gcc hello.c -o hello</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Run the Program:</strong> Execute the compiled program from the command line or terminal. For example, on Unix-based systems, use <code>./hello</code>, and on Windows, use <code>hello.exe</code>.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Your First C Program</h2>
        <p>Here’s a simple C program that prints “Hello, World!” to the console. This program demonstrates the basic structure of a C program:</p>
        <pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
        <p>This program includes the <code>stdio.h</code> header file, which is necessary for input and output functions. The <code>main</code> function is the entry point of every C program. Inside the <code>main</code> function, the <code>printf</code> function is used to print the text to the console.</p>

        <h2>Understanding C Syntax</h2>
        <p>Here are some fundamental aspects of C syntax you should be familiar with:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comments:</strong> Comments are used to explain code and are not executed. They can be single-line (using <code>//</code>) or multi-line (using <code>/* ... */</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Variables:</strong> Variables are used to store data. You must declare a variable before using it, specifying its type (e.g., <code>int</code>, <code>float</code>, <code>char</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Data Types:</strong> C supports various data types, including integers (<code>int</code>), floating-point numbers (<code>float</code>), and characters (<code>char</code>).</li>
            <li><strong>Control Structures:</strong> C provides control structures like <code>if</code> statements, <code>for</code> loops, and <code>while</code> loops to control the flow of the program.</li>
            <li><strong>Functions:</strong> Functions are blocks of code that perform specific tasks. You can define your own functions and call them from other parts of your program.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>Once you're comfortable with the basics of C, you can start exploring more advanced topics such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pointer Basics:</strong> Learn about pointers and how they can be used to manage memory and optimize performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Structures:</strong> Study common data structures like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.</li>
            <li><strong>File Handling:</strong> Understand how to read from and write to files using C.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Memory Allocation:</strong> Explore how to allocate and deallocate memory dynamically using functions like <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>.</li>
            <li><strong>Advanced C Concepts:</strong> Delve into more complex topics such as multi-threading, network programming, and interfacing with hardware.</li>
        </ul>
