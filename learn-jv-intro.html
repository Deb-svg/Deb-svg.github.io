    <h1>Learn Java</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the <strong>Learn Java</strong> series, your complete guide to mastering the fundamentals and advanced topics in Java programming. Java is one of the most popular and versatile programming languages, powering millions of applications across various platforms, from mobile phones to large-scale enterprise systems.</p>

    <p>This series is designed to take you through everything you need to know about Java, from the basics to more advanced concepts like object-oriented programming, exception handling, and working with collections. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer looking to learn Java, this guide will provide you with the knowledge and skills necessary to write powerful and efficient Java applications.</p>

    <h2>Why Learn Java?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility</strong> - Java's "Write Once, Run Anywhere" philosophy allows Java programs to run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it highly portable.</li>
        <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming</strong> - Java is built around the OOP paradigm, promoting the use of reusable code, modular programming, and ease of maintenance.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong Community Support</strong> - Java has a large and active community, which means plenty of resources, libraries, frameworks, and tools are available to support developers.</li>
        <li><strong>Enterprise Usage</strong> - Java is widely used in enterprises for building scalable, secure, and robust applications, making it a valuable skill for job opportunities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Writing Your First Java Program</h2>
    <p>Let’s start by setting up your environment and writing a simple "Hello, World!" program. Follow these steps to get started:</p>

    <h3>1. Setting Up Your Development Environment</h3>
    <p>To write and run Java programs, you need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK) and an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like <strong>IntelliJ IDEA</strong>, <strong>Eclipse</strong>, or <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>. Here's how to set it up:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Download and install the latest version of the JDK from the official Oracle website or use an open-source JDK like <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/">OpenJDK</a>.</li>
        <li>Install your preferred IDE, or you can use a simple text editor like <strong>Notepad++</strong> or <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> to write Java code.</li>
        <li>Make sure to configure your environment variables so that the Java compiler and runtime (javac and java commands) are accessible from the terminal/command line.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Writing Your First Java Program</h3>
    <p>Once your environment is set up, open your IDE or text editor and create a new Java file named <code>HelloWorld.java</code>. Type the following code:</p>

    <pre><code>public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Prints "Hello, World!" to the terminal window
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}</code></pre>

    <p>This program does the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>public class HelloWorld</strong> - Defines a class named <code>HelloWorld</code>. In Java, every application must have at least one class.</li>
        <li><strong>public static void main(String[] args)</strong> - This is the entry point for the program. The <code>main</code> method is where the execution begins.</li>
        <li><strong>System.out.println("Hello, World!");</strong> - This line prints the text <code>Hello, World!</code> to the console.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Compiling and Running the Program</h3>
    <p>To run this program, follow these steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Open your terminal/command prompt and navigate to the directory where your <code>HelloWorld.java</code> file is located.</li>
        <li>Compile the program using the following command:
            <pre><code>javac HelloWorld.java</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>If there are no errors, you will see a new file named <code>HelloWorld.class</code> in your directory. This is the compiled bytecode file.</li>
        <li>Run the program using this command:
            <pre><code>java HelloWorld</code></pre>
        </li>
        <li>You should see the output:
            <pre><code>Hello, World!</code></pre>
        </li>
    </ul>
